# NRAO DMS Technology Radar
The NRAO DMS Technology Radar is based on the [Thoughworks Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq-and-more). The radar tracks blips which are organized into two categories: quadrants and rings.

## Blips
A blip is a technology or technique that plays a role in software development.

## Quadrants
Quadrants represent different kinds of blips:
* Programming Languages and Frameworks
* Tools - Software development tools, version control systems, etc.
* Platforms - Software development infrastructure - things on which the software we develop relies.
* Techniques - Elements of software development and ways of structuring software (e.g. microservices).
 
## Rings
Rings inidicate the adoption lifecycle stage a blip should be in:
* Adopt - Use these items in DMS products.
* Trial - Target for adoption and can be evaluated in suitable projects.
* Assess - Evaluate to understand how it works and determine usefulness for DMS strategic goals. 
* Hold - Backlog or previous poor experience/do not use.

## Use
The radar can be created using the Thoughtworks [Build Your Own Radar](https://radar.thoughtworks.com) service and [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteheaddmark/Technology-Radar/master/nrao-dms-radar.json) raw JSON file.
